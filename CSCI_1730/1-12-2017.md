## Phases of a C++ Program*
1. Edit
    * program created in an editor
2. Preprocess
3. Compile
    * Compiler creates object code and stores on disk
4. Link
    * linker links object code with libraries
    * creates output and stores on disk
5. Load
    * loader loads program into memory
6. Execute
    * CPU executes instructions in program

## Differences from Java
* Java does not have a preprocessor; uses improts
* In C and C++, instead use header files to declare library objects
* Ex:
  * Java: `import java.lang.String;`
  * C++: `#include <string>`
* Java has an automatic garbage collector
* In C/C++, memory must be manually deallocated:
```
int *p_int = new int;
//use p_int
delete p_int;
```
## Hello World
```cpp
// hello.cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
  return 0;
}
```

## Compiling and Running
* Compile:
  * `g++ -c hello.cpp`
* Link:
  * `g++ -o hello hello.o`
