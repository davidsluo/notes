## How to Compile and Run

### Compilation:

$ make
```

### Cleaning

$ make clean
```

### Running
```
$ ./lab09 <filename>
```
OR
```
$ ./lab09 -
```
to read from `stdin`.

## Reflection
A lot from the previous lab carried over into this one, but there was a lot of 
new stuff too. I depended heavily on the man page for `stat` and and referred 
to documentation of `printf` to get everything formatted just right. At times,
I also looked into `stat`'s source code to verify my thinking, although it was
mostly for formatting.
