## Reflection
This lab turned out to be both harder and easier than expected. Easier in that
there was more abstracted away in the `ncurses` library than I initially
thought, but harder in that much of `ncurses` is not docuemnted well or the 
documentation is very old.

Also the way ncurses was written was intended for C rather than C++, so it's
less objected-oriented than previous libraries I've used, which made it 
somewhat more difficult to work with.
