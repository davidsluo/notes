## Reflection
This lab was pretty much exactly what I expected. Aside from a few minor 
differences that I did not take into account initially (mostly figuring
out how to loop through the values provided by `getline` and a minor
math error for `time`), there was not much that was a suprise.

I did, however, spend some time figuring out how to make a more generic
Makefile so that I didn't have to make an entry for every individual
program.
