# Lab 3
David Luo with Sophia Mapau and Stone Daniel

This lab is a lot like the last one where it is mostly a lot of math problems.
They all require use math in some way to solve a novel problem. Everything 
must be done without an array, so I'll loop through the input acquired through
`getline` instead of using an array. Most everything else is just math.
