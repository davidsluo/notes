## Reflection
When I started this lab, it looked a lot like a math problem. My initial
approach was to use purely math to extract the digits I wanted. However,
as I actually started working on the code, I realized that simply using a "mask"
would make it a lot easier to get the values I wanted. There's still some math
involved, but not nearly as much as I initially anticipated.

I think I probably could have more directly gotten to my final approach during
the brainstorm period, but most of the time I spent during the period was
reading over and trying to understand the actual assignment instead of figuring
out how to do it.
