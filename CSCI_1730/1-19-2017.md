## Fundamental data types cont.
Most data types can be signed or unsigned.
Literally means if a variable can have a positive/negative sign.

* unsigned - non-negative only
* signed - can be negative

|type|2^7|2^6|2^5|2^4|2^3|2^2|2^1|2^0|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|unsigned|||||||||
|signed|used for +/-||||||||

Data types are signed by default. Need to specify `unsigned` to unsign.

## Type Sizes
All fundamental types, except for `char`, have a minimum size.

Varies because processor processes in "words" - groups of 4 bytes. Sometimes processing words is more efficent than processing a single byte.

Can use `limits` library to get size of variable

## Floating Point Types
* size affects precision
* more size, more precision
* broken down into signifigcant and exponent
* Not exact, approximations
* Because of this lack of precision, must use a difference threshold to check for effective equality
* $|m-n|\leq x$
* never want to directly compare for equality.

## Bitwise Operators
* used to manipulate individual bits within a variable

|operator|asm equivalent|description|
|-|-|-|
|\&|AND|Bitwise AND|
|\||OR|Bitwise inclusive OR|
|^|XOR|Bitwise exclusive OR|
|~|NOT|Unary complement (bit inversion)|
|<<|SHL|Shift bits left|
|>>|SHR|Shift bits right|

* In practice, mainly used for optimization. i.e. in latency dependent applications, large data sets, where memory is scarce.
* Ex: use another type to store multiple booleans. Booleans use 4 bytes, even though they only need 1 bit.

All bitwise operators have assignment operators

|-|-|-|
|=\&|AND|
|=\||OR|
|=^|XOR|
|=~|NOT|
|=<<|SHL|
|=>>|SHR|

## Bitset
Can use `std::bitset` to print binary
* Ex:
```cpp
#include bitset;

unsigned short n = 4;

cout << n << endl;
cout << bitset<8>(n) << endl;
```
Output:
```
4
00000100
```
