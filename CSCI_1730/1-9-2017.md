 ### Logics and Proof
* Rules that distinguish right form wrong
* Valid and invalidmathematical statmenets
* Our goal: construct correct mathematica arguments
* Proofs are used to verify if something is right
* In CS, proofs are used to verify that programs are producing the correct output for **all** outputs
* **Proposition**: a statement that is either `true` or `false`. We may not know which one but it has to be one or the other
  * Ex:
    * $2 + 3 = 5$
    * Torronto is the capital of USA
    * 6 is divisible by 2
  * Not propositions:
    * Read this carefully
    * What time is it?
    * $x + 3 = 5$
* **Axioms**: same thing as propositions except that we **assume** that they are true
  * Ex:
    * $A + B = B + A$
* **Deductions**: logical reasoning
  * Deductive logic deals with truth preservation
  * Ex:
    * if it has rained, then the gras is wet.
      * It has rained,
      * therefore the grass is wet
    * All men are mortal; Clark Kent is a man.
      * therefore Clark Kent is mortal
* All ahve similar structure
  * All A are B
  * B is C
  * therefore A is C

#### Arguments
* Arguements consist of:
  * a set of propositions and
  * B is C
  * therefore A is C

#### The role of logic:
  * Logic is intended to tell us:
    * when a conclusion can correcgtly be inferred from the premises
    * that is, when the conclusion "follows from" the premises
  * there are different tyupes of logic and they give different acounts of what is "good" and "bad" reasoning
* **Deductive** Logic deals with **truth preservation**

#### Propositions
* A declarative sentence that is either `true` or `false`
* Must be either true or false. Cannot be both or neither.

##### Compound Propositions
* combination of multiple propsitions
* Ex:
  * p = "Cruise ships only go on big rivers."
  * q = "cruise ships go on the Hudson"
  * r = "the hudson is a big river."
  * not r = "the hudson is not a big river"
  * p^q = "cruise ships only go on big rivers and go on the hudson. "
  * ~~p^q -> r = "if cruise ships on "~~

### Implication
* if $p$ and $q$ are propositions, then $p \to q$ is a conditional statement or implication is read as *"if $p$ then $q$"*
* in $p \to q$, $p$ is the *hypothesis* (antecedent or premise) and $q$ is the *conclusion* (or consequence).
* truth table

* ex: "if i am elected, then i will lower taxes"
  * will not lower taxes not matter what if not elected
