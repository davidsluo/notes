## Type Inference and Deduction
C++ can automatically infer the variable type.

Ex:
```cpp
int foo = 0;
auto bar = foo; // bar is type int.
```

## Standard Strings
Needs string header.
```cpp
#include <string>
```

## Constants
Use `const` keyword
```cpp
const double PI = 3.14159;
```
or use a preprocessor directive
```cpp
#define PI 3.14159
```

Difference:
* `const` is looked up during compilation.
* preprocessor directive is 

## Comma Separator
Used to separate two or more expressions that are included
where only one expression is expected.

Ex:
```cpp
a = (b=3, b+2);
```
Equivalent to:
```cpp
b=3;
a=b+2;
```

## Streams
Abstraction that perform input and output operations in sequential media,
such as the screen, keyboard, or a file.

Standard library includes several streams for standard sources and destiations
* cin
* cout
* cerr
* clog

### getline
Allows you to get the entire line from `cin`

### stringstream
* From `<sstream>`
* defines `streamstream` that allows string to be treated as sstream
* very useful for converting strings to numerical values and vice versa.

## goto
* Makes absolute jump to another point in program.
* Litterally goto another line of code
* completely ignores nesting levels, and does not cause any automatic stack 
unwinding.
* Should therefore be used very carefully.
* Destination is defined by a *label* which is used as an argument for the 
`goto` statement
