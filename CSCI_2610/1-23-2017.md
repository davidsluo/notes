### Nested Qualifiers
Nested quantifiers are often necessary to express teh meaning of sentences in english as well as important concepts in CS and math.

Ex:
>Every real number has an additive inverse.

$$\forall x \exists y (x+y=0)$$

where the domains of x and y are real numbers

Ex:

$P(x,y): x \times y = 0$

* $\forall x \forall y P(x,y)$
  * False
* $\exists x \forall y P(x,y)$
  * True
* $\forall x \exists y P(x,y)$
  * True
* $\exists x \exists y P(x,y)$
  * True
