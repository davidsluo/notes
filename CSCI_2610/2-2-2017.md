## Proof By Contraposition
Assume $\neg q$ and show $\neg p$ is true also. THis is sometimes called an
*indirect proof* method. if we give a direct proof of $\neg q \implies \neg q$
then we have a proof of $p \implies q$
* Works becuase $p \implies q \equiv \neg q \implies \neg p$

## Proof by Contradiction
TO proove $p$, assusme $\neg p$ and derive a contradiction such as $r \land \neg r$ (an indrect form of proof).
