## Universally Quantified Assertions
To prove theorms in the form $\forall x P(x)$, assume $x$ is an arbitrary member of the domain and show that $P(x)$ must be true. Using UG it follows that $\forall x P(x)$.
## Existence Proofs
Proof of theorems in the form $\exists x P(x)$

### Constructive existence proof:
* Find an explicit value of $c$ such that $P(c)$ is true.
* Then $\exists x P(x)$ is true by Existential Generalization (EG).

### Nonconstructive existence proofs
In a *nonconstructive existence proof*, we can assume no $c$ exists that makes $P(c)$ true and derive a contradiction.

## Counterexamples
Recall $\exists x \neg P(x) \equiv \neg \forall x P(x)$

To establish that $\neg \forall x P(x)$ is true, find a *c* such that $\neg P(c)$ is true and $P(c)$ is false.

In this case, *c* is called a *counterexample* to the assertion $\forall x P(x)$.
