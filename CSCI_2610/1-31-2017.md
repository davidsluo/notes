## Proofs
Many theorms have the form
$$\forall x (P(x) \implies Q(x))$$
To prove, must show that arbitrary member of domain, $c$, satisfies the theorm.
$$P(c) \implies Q(c)$$

### Trivial Proof 
If we know $q$ is true, then $p \implies q$ is true as well.

### Vacuous Proof 
If we know $p$ is false then $p \implies q$ is true

### Direct Proof 
Assume that $p$ is true. Use rules of inference, axioms and logical equivalences to show that $q$ must also be true.
