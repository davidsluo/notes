## Theorms that are biconditional statements
to prove a theorm that is a biconditional statement ($p \iff q$), we show that
$p \implies q$ and $q \implies p$ are both true.

## Proof by Cases
To prove a conditional statement in the form:
$$(p_1 \lor p_2 \lor ... \lor p_n) \implies q$$

Use the Tautology:
$$[(p_1 \lor p_2 \lor ... \lor p_n) \implies q] \iff [(p_1 \implies q) \land (p_2 \implies q) \land ...\land (p_n \implies q)]$$

i.e. prove that all the different possible cases for a condition is true to prove that the overall condition is true.
