# Reflection

```
In your protocols, does the transport layer "have to do anything" in the core of the computer network?
```

The transport-layer protocols only specify how to format data and how to 
interpret the formatted data so that the "network core" can transport it. The
transport-layer protocols themselves are not directly involved in the transport
of data from Point A to Point B.
