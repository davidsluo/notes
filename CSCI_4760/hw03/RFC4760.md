# RFC 4760

David Luo - 811357331

## Segments

A simple network-layer protocol that delivers data from a host to a destination.
This protocol assumes that the Internet Protocol (IP) is 

```
 0             15 16            31
+----------------+----------------+
|   Destination  |     Length     |
|      Port      |                |
+----------------+----------------+
|           Data Octets... 
+----------------+--------------...
```

### Fields

* **Destination Port** - A 16-bit unsigned integer representing the target port
    on the destination address.
* **Length** - A 16-bit unsigned integer representing the length of the `Data 
    Octets` as a count of octets. This has a theoretical maximum of 8192 octets.
* **Data Octets...** - A variable length field containing the actual bits to be
    sent to the destination. Must be padded to lengths of multiples of eight bits.

## Sender

The protocol breaks down application-layer messages into 8-bit segments, 
prepending the segment header, as described above. If the length of the data is
greater than the maximum length that can be sent in a single packet, 
additional packets are sent.

## Reciever

The reciever is passed data from the network-layer and reassembles the segments
into data usable by the application layer, essentially a reverse of the sender
side of the protocol.
